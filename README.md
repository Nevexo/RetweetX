# RetweetX

RetweetX is now in an archived state, or at least will be for the foreseeable future.

This project is rather old & not really written to proper standards. I mean, what's the point in static-typing when you set everything to all?

## MixerRetweet

RetweetX was orignally built for [Mixer Retweet](https://twitter.com/MixerRetweet) a Twitter account designed for promoting Mixer (a streaming platform) streamers.

Mixer recently made the accouncement to shut down Mixer.com, thus, the MixerRetweet account was shut down.

This repo contains the source used for building RetweetX, it was managed by PM2 & had some other cron jobs for maintaining the database & a web interface that I haven't included in this repo.

Feel free to use it, though I doubt anyone will.

## Things Worthy of Note

- TSC will likely fail on strict settings (as this codebase is horrible)
- Many features aren't implemented (such as user following)
- There's no docs for configuring the databse nor using the system.
- Some of the config flags don't really do anything.

I may continue this project eventually, but for now it remains as is.

Thanks for using Mixer Retweet.
